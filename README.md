### San Francisco • New York • Full-time 
### Why we're looking for you 
<p>Our customer base is growing fast along with the features we are adding to support them. As a result we have more questions, feedback, and tickets coming in than ever before. As we continue to grow, we’re adding customer-facing Associate Support Engineers to triage technical issues and advocate for our users.

### What you'll do 
<p>As an Associate Support Engineer you’ll be the customer’s first point of contact as they encounter roadblocks.

### Who you'll work with 
<p>You’ll work with support engineers and software engineers to diagnose, troubleshoot, and solve customer problems. You will also partner with product to consult on new features and areas for improvement related to the issues you encounter. Support is a small team today, but rapidly expanding to match our customer growth. 
You’ll be joining a broader team of Retools who are passionate about serving our customers, enjoy collaborating to build an incredibly innovative product, and partake in some occasional-but-well-intentioned sarcasm. If this sounds like you, we’d love to hear from you!

● Foundational knowledge of Javascript and SQL   
● Knowledge of common data types and structures   
● Ability to teach and explain technical topics   
● Related experience working directly with customers in a technical role
