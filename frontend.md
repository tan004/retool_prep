- React Real DOM vs. Virtual DOM, how they work together

- Request/Response Cycle (What happens when you press enter after entering valid web address)

- What will the resulting Status Code be, assuming that process went well?

- Maybe ask about what a web address is an alias for (looking to hear IP address)

- A hypothetical about data flow, how data is passed between front end, back end, and database to retrieve data to display to the end user

- Can you explain the Event Loop in JavaScript?
